# **Step 1: Our Understanding of the Platform**

The proposed platform is a next-generation, immersive learning system tailored for law firm clients. Its objective is to help these firms **streamline internal processes, elevate training standards, and improve decision-making consistency** across legal teams.

Rather than offering a traditional Learning Management System (LMS), the platform introduces a **visually rich, gamified learning experience** inspired by the world of professional sports. *Users are onboarded into a league system (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) and guided through structured "Match Days" that simulate a competitive yet motivating environment for learning.*

Each Match Day consists of educational content (videos, quizzes, simulations), with performance feedback and intelligent adaptations delivered via an AI-powered digital mentor: 

**Coach Klaus**.

Key innovations that distinguish the platform:

- **Adaptive Learning Engine** powered by a Confidence Score system and Processing Intelligence Engine (PIE), capable of identifying weak areas and injecting remedial content
- **Coach Klaus Avatar**, integrated using D-ID technology, who acts as a visible, emotionally aware learning companion
- **Gamification system** including achievements, rewards, progression leagues, and unlockable content
- **Modular content architecture** that enforces structured progression and discourages skipping ahead
- **PIE Submission Phase**, where users apply their learnings to real-world legal processes and receive AI-generated insights and feedback

<aside>

The platform will built on a **phased development approach**, starting with a Figma-based UI and React frontend while leaving room for future evolution into full 3D interactive environments using tools like Unity or Unreal Engine.

</aside>

# **Step 2: How the Course Will Be Created**

The learning experience is structured around the concept of **“Match Days”**, each representing a complete learning cycle within a module. The full curriculum consists of **10 modules**, and each module follows the same core instructional architecture:

---

### **Modular Content Structure**

Each Match Day includes:

> **Introductory message** from Coach Klaus (pre-recorded video)
> 
- **Core learning content**:
    - Short videos (≈5 mins)
    - Interactive quizzes (multiple choice, no time limits)
    - Branching scenario-based exercises (“choose your own path”)
- **Application Phase**:
    - “Transfer Application” task (from Match Day 5 onward)
    - Users describe a real-world process via text, voice, or uploaded document
    - AI analyzes this input and gives actionable feedback

---

### **Content Authoring Requirements**

<aside>

All course materials will be created and maintained by the client’s content team. This includes:

</aside>

| Content Type | Provided By Client | Format |

<aside>

> Development cannot begin on a Match Day until the corresponding content has been provided and finalized.
> 

---

### **Future-Proofing**

- Content is designed to be modular, allowing future Match Days to be added.
- Structured in a way to support localization/multilingual expansion later.
</aside>

---

# Step 3: How Users Will Be Onboarded

The onboarding flow is designed to create a sense of **personalized entry into a competitive, league-based learning ecosystem** replacing the typical dry LMS login with a more engaging and diagnostic process.

---

### **Onboarding Journey Overview**

1. **Taktikcheck Booking**
    - Users are invited to book a **Taktikcheck** (strategy check) a human-guided onboarding session.
    - The invitation includes a link to a **pre-assessment questionnaire**.
2. **Trainer Evaluation**
    - A certified human trainer evaluates the user in a 1-on-1 or group session (in-person or remote).
    - Points are assigned based on skill level, mindset, and understanding across each module.
3. **League Assignment**
    - Based on performance, the user is assigned to a **league (1–3) per module**.
        - Beginner League → Local Training Pitch UI
        - Intermediate League → Small Stadium UI
        - Expert League → Full Dome Stadium UI
    
    <aside>
    
    ### Expanded League Assignment Process
    
    After the user completes their **Taktikcheck** (via questionnaire and/or in-person assessment), the league assignment process begins. This phase is partly manual and allows the platform administrators to tailor the learning experience for each user based on their evaluation results.
    
    ### **Operational Flow:**
    
    1. **Assessment Completion**
        - User submits pre-check form and completes an in-person/virtual evaluation with a certified trainer.
    2. **Admin Dashboard Access**
        - The internal admin/trainer logs into the **Admin Dashboard**.
    3. **User Account Setup**
        - If the user is new:
            - The admin **creates a new account** for the user.
            - The system can auto-send login credentials via email.
        - If the user exists:
            - The admin **searches and selects** the user profile.
    4. **Course Selection**
        - The admin can either:
            - **Assign existing modules** (Match Days) to the user
            - Or **create a new course bundle** depending on the user's specialization or role.
    5. **League Assignment per Module**
        - For each module (e.g., Legal Research, Client Intake, Documentation):
            - The admin selects the appropriate **league level (1–3)** based on the Taktikcheck results.
            - This assignment determines the **visual environment**, **difficulty level**, and **Coach Klaus tone** for each module.
    6. **User Notification + Visual Feedback**
        - Once all leagues are assigned, the user receives:
            - A **visual summary of their league standing** — shown as a dartboard-style interface or a stadium map.
            - A motivational message from Coach Klaus welcoming them to their personal journey.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Why League Assignment Matters**
    
    - Each user's journey becomes **personalized** while staying within a structured system.
    - It allows **modular progress** users can be Expert in one area and Beginner in another.
    - It reinforces the sports metaphor by assigning a competitive, progress-based narrative to training.
        
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            A["Taktikcheck Completed"] --> B["Admin Logs into Dashboard"]
            B --> C["Create New User OR Select Existing User"]
            C --> D["Select or Create Course Bundle (Match Days)"]
            D --> E["Assign League Level (1–3) Per Module"]
            E --> F["Save & Confirm Assignments"]
            F --> G["System Generates Visual Summary (e.g., Dartboard View)"]
            G --> H["User Receives Welcome Message from Coach Klaus + Login Details"]
        
        ```
        
    </aside>
    
    - A **visual result summary** is shown (e.g., dartboard-style view) to reinforce the competitive feel.
    
    <aside>
    
    ### What a “Dartboard-Style View” Means
    
    Imagine a **circular diagram** that visually represents all 10 modules arranged around the center  like the slices of a dartboard. Each slice corresponds to one module (e.g., Documentation, Legal Research, Client Management, etc.), and the **color or depth of each slice indicates the user’s league**:
    
    - **Center (Bullseye)** = Expert League
    - **Middle ring** = Intermediate League
    - **Outer ring** = Beginner League
    
    So when the user sees the dartboard:
    
    - They can immediately recognize **which areas they’re strong in** (closer to the center)
    - And **where they need to improve** (outer areas)
    
    This gives a **quick, emotionally engaging overview** of their strengths and weaknesses like a **personal performance radar**.
    
    </aside>
    
4. **Welcome Message from Coach Klaus**
    - After league assignment, a **pre-recorded video from Coach Klaus** welcomes the user and explains how to navigate the platform.
    - The user is guided to start their first Match Day.

<aside>

Once users complete onboarding, they are taken directly into their first Match Day, with league-specific visuals and Coach Klaus guidance based on their assigned path.

</aside>

# Step 4: How Their Learning Journey Will Look Like

The user’s journey is organized around the metaphor of **“Match Days,”** with each Match Day representing a focused, structured learning cycle inside a dynamic sports-themed environment. The journey is both **linear in structure** and **adaptive in depth**, ensuring engagement, accountability, and personalized growth.

---

### **Core Learning Loop Match Day Structure**

Each Match Day follows a clearly defined sequence:

1. **Proactive Introduction by Coach Klaus**
    - A **pre-recorded welcome video** appears automatically, offering context, motivation, and an overview of today’s learning path.
2. **Content Engagement**
    - Users complete a mix of learning components:
        - **Short instructional videos** (~5 minutes)
        - **Interactive quizzes** with unlimited attempts (no time pressure)
        - **Branching scenarios** to simulate real decisions
3. **Adaptive Support via Confidence Score**
    - A **Confidence Score** is calculated in the background based on:
        - Time taken to complete quizzes
        - Repeat views of content
        - Uncertain/confused AI questions
    - Based on this score, the system may:
        - Adjust Coach Klaus’s tone (more supportive or more demanding)
        - Inject simplified content or extra explanations where needed
4. **On-Demand Support - Coach Klaus Interaction**
    - Users can **click on Klaus’s avatar** at any time to ask a question.
    - ***Klaus responds based on current lesson context using an AI model (LLaMA 3.3) and company knowledge base.***
    - Responses appear as **voice + subtitle**, driven by D-ID avatar animation.

1. **Transfer Application Phase** *(from Match Day 5 onward)*
    - Users are prompted by Coach Klaus to apply their learning by describing a real-world process from their legal work.
    - Submissions can be in **text, voice, or document** format.
    - The PIE engine analyzes submissions using the LLM and returns:
        - Weak points in reasoning
        - Recommendations or improvements
        - Confidence level of the analysis
2. **Completion Summary by Coach Klaus**
    - A pre-recorded summary video from Klaus wraps up the session.
    - If applicable, new content is unlocked or points are rewarded.
    
    <aside>
    
    ### **Real-Life Example: Transfer Application Phase**
    
    **User Role**: Paralegal at a mid-sized corporate law firm
    
    **Module**: "Client Onboarding & Conflict Checks" (Match Day 5)
    
    ---
    
    ### **Coach Klaus Prompt**:
    
    > “Now that you’ve completed this Match Day, let’s put your knowledge into action.
    > 
    > 
    > Please describe how your firm currently handles new client intake and conflict of interest checks. Try to highlight key steps, decision points, and any tools involved.”
    > 
    
    ---
    
    ### **User Submission**:
    
    The user records a **voice note** (or types out a text response) like:
    
    > “At our firm, the receptionist collects basic client info and passes it to a junior associate who fills out a client intake form. Then, someone from compliance manually searches our database to see if there's a conflict. If a conflict is found, it goes to a senior partner. Otherwise, we open a new file and assign a billing code.”
    > 
    
    ---
    
    ### **PIE (Processing Intelligence Engine) Output**:
    
    After analyzing the submission using the LLaMA model, the PIE might return:
    
    - **Weakness Identified**:
        - Manual conflict checks introduce a bottleneck and risk of oversight.
    - **Recommendation**:
        - Consider integrating automated conflict check software with centralized access to client history and billing records.
    - **Confidence Score**: 72%
        - Shows good grasp of the intake steps but lacks proactive risk mitigation strategies.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Coach Klaus Completion Summary** (Pre-recorded):
    
    > “Great job applying your knowledge to a real-world scenario.
    > 
    > 
    > I noticed some gaps in how conflicts are flagged at your firm that’s common. Check the extra video in your Reward Locker to learn how top-performing firms automate this step.
    >

# Step 5: How Coach Klaus Will Interact with Users

Coach Klaus is the user’s **personal mentor and motivational guide** throughout the platform. Designed using **D-ID avatar technology**, Coach Klaus appears both as a **pre-scripted character** and a **responsive AI assistant** creating a hybrid interaction model that balances consistency, intelligence, and personality.

---

### **Two Modes of Interaction**

### 1. **Proactive Mode (Pre-scripted Video Prompts)**

Coach Klaus automatically appears at the start of every Match Day (intro)

This videos are pre-recorded and embedded directly into the UI, varying in tone based on the user’s assigned league (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert).

### 2. **Reactive Mode (User-Initiated Questions)**

During any lesson, the user sees Klaus as an **animated avatar** (looping video/image).

- If the user clicks on the avatar, it opens an **AI-driven chat session**.
- Klaus provides a **spoken response (text-to-speech + subtitles)** *using D-ID and an LLM (LLaMA 3.3) hosted on AWS SageMaker.*
- Responses are tailored using:
    - Context of the current lesson
    - User’s Confidence Score
    - Available company knowledge base and lesson metadata

---

### **Behavioral Intelligence**

- Klaus adapts his **tone and language** based on user behavior.
    - If a user is struggling, his tone becomes more encouraging and supportive.
    - If a user is excelling, his tone becomes more direct and performance-driven.
- This is powered by the **Confidence Score Engine**, which continuously updates based on:
    - Repeated content views
    - Question phrasing indicating confusion
    - Delayed quiz completions

---

<aside>

### **Interaction Rules & Limits**

- Users receive a **limited number of Klaus interactions per Match Day** (e.g., 3 per session).
- Additional interactions can be **unlocked** using earned credits or via the Reward Shop.
- All interactions are logged for future personalization and platform improvement.
</aside>

---

# Step 6: What the Gamification Elements Will Look Like

Gamification is not just an add-on it’s **deeply embedded** into the platform’s structure and storytelling. Drawing inspiration from the world of competitive sports, the system creates an environment where **progress, recognition, and mastery** are at the core of the learning journey.

---

### **League System**

- Users are assigned to one of three **Leagues** per module during onboarding:
    - **Beginner League**
    - **Intermediate League**
    - **Expert League**
- The league system influences:
    - **Visual style** of the UI
    - **Tone** of Coach Klaus interactions
    - **Pacing** of content recommendations (e.g., more support in Beginner League)

---

### **Achievements & Milestones**

- Users unlock **badges**, **trophies**, and **medals** for:
    - Completing a Match Day
    - Achieving a high quiz score
    - Improving their Confidence Score
    - Finishing all modules in a specific league
    - Engaging in the Transfer Application phase
- All achievements are displayed in a personal “**Highlight Wall**” within the community/profile section.

---

### **Credit & Reward System**

- Users earn **credits** by:
    - Completing tasks and quizzes
    - Submitting Transfer Applications
    - Participating in live sessions or workshops
- Credits can be redeemed in a **Reward Shop** for:
    - Additional Coach Klaus interactions
    - Access to bonus content
    - Downloadable resources or early unlocks

---

### **Coach’s Notebook (Storyboard)**

- After each Match Day, a **one-sentence summary** of key learning is added to the user’s **Coach’s Notebook**.
- This notebook helps track progress and reflects accumulated insights.
- Users can export or review it at any time especially useful before live sessions or assessments.

---

### **Psychological Impact**

- The gamification system is built around:
    - **Progression**: through leagues and modules
    - **Mastery**: through increasing difficulty and branching decisions
    - **Recognition**: through public and private achievements
    - **Autonomy**: through the Reward Shop and optional paths

---

Gamification in this platform is **motivational by design**, helping to ensure high engagement, repeat usage, and a strong sense of ownership over the learning journey.

---

# Step 7: LLM & AI Implementation

At the heart of the platform’s adaptive learning experience is a powerful AI stack composed of a **self-hosted LLaMA 3.3 model**, combined with a proprietary **Prompt Engine** (internally referred to as **ErxlebenGPT**) that controls tone, behavior, and memory.

This system powers **Coach Klaus**, enabling real-time, emotionally intelligent, and context-aware interactions far beyond traditional chatbot models.

### **Model Architecture: LLaMA 3.3 + ErxlebenGPT**

- The platform uses **Meta’s LLaMA 3.3 (70B parameters)** as the foundation model.
- The model is **self-hosted on Hetzner infrastructure in Frankfurt**, fully managed by our team.
- On top of the base model runs **ErxlebenGPT**, a proprietary Prompt Engine that:
    - Defines Coach Klaus’s role and personality
    - Interprets session memory and user behavior
    - Controls tone, emotional reactivity, and adaptability

### **Key AI Capabilities**

- When a user clicks on Coach Klaus, the system:
    - Gathers contextual variables: current lesson, module ID, confidence score, user memory
    - Sends this to the Prompt Engine via API
    - Generates a tailored response (in the correct tone) and renders it via **D-ID avatar** (video + subtitle or audio)

### 1. **Coach Klaus Live Interactions**

### 2. **Transfer Application (PIE) Feedback**

- During Match Day 5 and onward, users submit real-world examples (text, voice, or document)
- The AI analyzes:
    - Logical accuracy
    - Strengths and weaknesses
    - Recommendations tied to specific learning outcomes
- Output is stored in the user’s **Session Memory** and may influence future interventions

### 3. **Adaptive Decision Engine (ADE)**

- The backend uses AI to detect learning friction based on:
    - Repeated quiz failures
    - Help requests using confused phrasing
    - Excessive time spent on a task
- Klaus adjusts by:
    - Recommending simpler content
    - Offering motivational or more directive guidance
    - Logging the behavior for future learning path adjustments

### **Session Memory Layer**

- A persistent memory system tracks:
    - Questions the user asked
    - Past confidence scores
    - Behavior patterns across Match Days
    - Feedback history from PIE

This enables Coach Klaus to **recall interactions weeks or months later**, continuing conversations and adapting his coaching style based on the user’s journey.

### **Security & Privacy**

- All AI components run within a GDPR-compliant infrastructure (Hetzner)
- No data is passed to external LLM APIs
- Session logs are encrypted and auditable for compliance purposes

This architecture allows Coach Klaus to function as a true AI consultant capable of recognizing patterns, recalling past challenges, and adjusting tone and content in real time, creating a deeply personal and human-like learning experience.

---

# Step 8: Design Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Implementation of Client-Provided UI Designs**

This phase focuses on developing a **fully functional learning platform** based on the 2D designs, visual assets, and layout references **provided by the client**.

There will be **no 3D rendering, spatial transitions, immersive depth effects, or in-room avatar placement**. Our team will **not be responsible for producing designs**, but will ensure accurate technical implementation using **React (or Node.js-based)** technology stack.

---

### What We Will Deliver in Phase 1

| Element | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Design to Code** | Build the full UI and frontend logic based on **client-supplied Figma or equivalent design files**, without deviation or redesign |
| **League-Based UI Flow** | Implement screen logic for each league level (Beginner = Locker Room, Intermediate = Tunnel, Expert = Stadium) as styled in your design files |
| **Coach Klaus Integration** | Coach Klaus will be embedded using the **D-ID embeddable widget**. While we can trigger interactions based on user behavior, please note that D-ID avatars are rendered in a fixed container and **cannot appear spatially within a room or interact with other visual elements** |
| **Gamification Logic** | Trophies, badges, league indicators, and match progress will be rendered and managed per the logic defined, **styled according to your visual assets** |
| **Navigation** | Build tabbed or sidebar navigation (standard UI patterns), as reflected in the provided designs **no camera transitions or animated room shifts** |
| **No Design Redesign** | Our team will **not be involved in producing or revising visual concepts**. Any revisions or visual storytelling updates will need to come from your design vendor or internal team |

> Goal: Translate the client’s 2D visual designs into a responsive and technically sound Project. No immersive 3D effects or spatial continuity will be part of this scope.
> 

---

# **Step 9: Timeline & Milestone Breakdown**

Phase 1 focuses on delivering the complete MVP of the learning platform using a **lean, conventional UI enhanced with league-based visuals**, integrated with AI components, gamification, and Coach Klaus support.

> **Estimated Timeline: ~** 4 months
> 
> 
> **Estimated Cost**: $30,000 – $32,000 USD
> 

---

### **Timeline Overview (4–5 Months)**

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestones |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core LMS Development** | 5 Weeks | Match Day engine, league assignment logic, quiz flows |
| **Gamification Layer** | 2 Weeks (parallel) | Trophies, points, reward logic |
| **Coach Klaus (DID + AI)** | 2–3 Weeks | Click-to-interact flow, response injection, tone control |
| **PIE Integration** | 2–3 Weeks | Transfer application submission + AI analysis |
| **Full Integration & QA** | 2 Weeks | Staging tests, bug fixing, mobile/device responsiveness |
| **Client Review + UAT** | 1 Week | Feedback & polishing |
| **Go-Live (MVP)** | – | With 3–5 complete Match Days |

<aside>

> ⚠️ Remaining Match Days and additional features (e.g., multi-language, reward shop content) can be added post-MVP.
> 
</aside>

<aside>

> ⚠️ Note: The pricing range reflects the current scope and is subject to final adjustment after the discovery phase. Once all user flows and design requirements are finalized, *the cost will be locked within this range.*
> 
</aside>

<aside>

> **Technical Note:**
> 
> 
> Initially, the plan was to use the **Aliph Alpha API** for LLM-based features. However, due to GDPR-related limitations and licensing concerns, we are now shifting to an **open-source LLM (LLaMA 3.3)** hosted on **AWS SageMaker**.
> 
> This change introduces additional responsibilities including:
> 
- LLM deployment and optimization
- Fine Tuning (if needed for better domain accuracy)
- Ongoing model inference management

These aspects have been accounted for in the current scope and pricing.

</aside>

# **Cost Clarification – $30K–$32K**

**Transparent Explanation:**

You're absolutely right to ask for clarity here's a breakdown of why the estimate increased compared to the earlier ballpark of $27,500:

| Item | Change |
| --- | --- |
| **LLM Infrastructure** | Originally assumed API access (e.g., Aleph Alpha). Now shifted to a **self-hosted model (LLaMA 3.3)** on Hetzner, which requires: 
  • Deployment & setup
  • Prompt routing
  • Load handling
  • Session memory integration |
| **AI Fine-Tuning + Custom Prompt Engine** | We now account for the integration of **ErxlebenGPT** – including memory hooks, emotional tone logic, confidence score handling |
| **Expanded Learning Formats** | The scope now includes interactive simulations, pinboards, flowchart tools, and detailed quiz branching logic which significantly expands front-end development complexity |

---

# **Next Steps**

We appreciate the clarity and depth of our discussions so far. Based on the agreed direction, here’s how we propose moving forward:

### 1. **Finalize Discovery (Current Milestone – $1,200 USD)**

- Convert the platform scope into detailed **user stories and task breakdowns**
- Define all core components for Phase 1 (LMS modules, user roles, interaction flows, content requirements)
- Outline design references, tone, and technical boundaries

### 2. **Move to Design Phase**

- Begin designing the UI in Figma based on league-based visual structure and screen-by-screen flows
- Prepare component library, visual themes for each league, and layout for key modules (Dashboard, Match Day, Coach Klaus interaction, etc.)
- Align design output with frontend structure for efficient handoff

### 3. **Prepare Timeline & Sprint Plan**

- Break the full Phase 1 execution into **bi-weekly sprints** with estimated deliverables and review points
- Identify content dependencies (e.g., quiz bank, Coach Klaus scripts) that will be required from the client team

---

# **Closing Remarks**

We’re excited to help bring this innovative learning platform to life. The combination of immersive theming, adaptive AI interaction, and gamification mechanics makes it a standout vision and we’re confident in our ability to deliver it within the agreed roadmap.

Our team is fully aligned with the confirmed Option 2 direction (Figma + React-based immersive interface) and we’ve structured both our architecture and planning to keep things lean, scalable, and future-ready with a clear upgrade path into full 3D immersive learning in Phase 2.

We look forward to finalizing the discovery tasks and kicking off design!
