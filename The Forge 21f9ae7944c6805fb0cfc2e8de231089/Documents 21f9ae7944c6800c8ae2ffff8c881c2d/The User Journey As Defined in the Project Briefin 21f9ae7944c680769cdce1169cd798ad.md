Author: Nouman Javaid, Bilal Khalid

This document outlines the user journey as described in the

[**Discovery_Detailed_Project_Briefing.pdf](https://renesistech-my.sharepoint.com/personal/noumanjavaid_renesistech_com/Documents/Microsoft%20Copilot%20Chat%20Files/Discovery_Detailed_Project_Briefing.pdf) that was shared.** Each step includes direct references to the source [](https://www.notion.so/21f9ae7944c6809d898cfff73cf4cafb?pvs=21) document for clarity and traceability.

This is the foundational phase where the user is introduced to the platform and the system gathers the initial data required for personalization. The entire process is detailed in

### **Phase 1: Onboarding & Initial Assessment**

`Section 8.1: "Getting started & onboarding - experience module and tactics check" (Page 30)**.`

</aside>

- **Step 2: Preparation Phase**
    - After booking, the firm receives an automated email confirming the appointment. This email includes a link to a preparatory questionnaire. This is described as the first "training session" and provides the system with its first individual data points.
        - **Step 1: Booking & Start**
            - The law firm books the "tactics check" via the platform's online store. Immediately after booking, they are directed to a start page with a welcome video and a calendar tool (e.g., [Cal.com](http://cal.com/)) to schedule their on-site appointment.

                **Question: Do we have an intervention here at this point what would be our role?**

- **Step 3: First Contact with Coach Klaus**
    - Upon completing the preparation questionnaire, the user receives their first communication from Coach Klaus in the form of a short video. This serves as the initial emotional connection to the AI character.

    - *Reference: Section 8.1, "Step 3: Initial contact with Coach Klaus" (Page 30).*
    </aside>

- **Step 4: The "Tactics Check"**
    - This is a physical, on-site meeting with a human trainer from the Zukunftsschmiede team. The trainer uses a dedicated interface to guide the law firm through a structured survey consisting of **5-10 questions per module**. All data is captured and stored in the system's "session memory" to be used by the Adaptive Decision Engine.

    - *Reference: Section 8.1, "Step 5: Tactics check on site" (Page 31).*
    </aside>

- **Step 5: Evaluation & League Classification**
    - At the end of the tactics check, the results are presented visually. The briefing specifies an **"animated dartboard"** to represent performance in each module. Based on these results, the firm is assigned to one of three leagues: **Starting league, Taktgeberliga, or Playmaker league**. Coach Klaus moderates this evaluation and provides motivating closing words.

### **Phase 2: The Core Learning Loop (The "Match Day")**

This is the central, recurring part of the user experience, where the actual learning and interaction take place. This is detailed in **Section 8.2: "Procedure of a match day" (Page 32)**.

- **Learning as a Team**
    - The platform is designed for the law firm to go through each "match day" as a team, not as individuals. The recommended rhythm is two match days per week, each lasting approximately **45-60 minutes**.

    <aside>
    ⛔

    - *Reference: Section 8.2, "Learning together as a team" (Page 32).*
    </aside>

- **The 5+1 Phase Structure**
    - Each match day follows a consistent didactic structure, ensuring a balanced learning experience:
1. **Attunement:** An intro by Coach Klaus to set the context.
2. **Knowledge Impulse:** The core content, delivered via video or animated explanations.
3. **Processing:** Interactive elements like quizzes and reflection questions.
4. **Transfer Application:** Applying the knowledge, for example by submitting a real-world process to the Process Intelligence Engine (PIE).
5. Conclusion & Motivation: A summary, feedback on league progress, and a mini challenge.

    +1. Resilience & Regeneration: Flexible impulses for emotional strengthening.

- **The Role of Coach Klaus during a Match Day**
    - Coach Klaus acts as an emotional and adaptive companion, not just a knowledge provider. He welcomes the team, provides motivation, reflects on past progress, and is available for questions via voice input.

### **Phase 3: Continuous Engagement & Development**

This phase describes how the platform maintains engagement and supports the user's development over the long term.

- **Ongoing Support from Coach Klaus**
    - Coach Klaus is always present but not intrusive. He proactively provides reminders for upcoming match days, offers encouragement for strong performance, and gives feedback on progress. His behavior is controlled by the **Adaptive Decision Engine (ADE)** and the **Confidence Score**, making his interactions feel context-aware and personalized.

    <aside>
    ⛔

    - *Reference: Section 8.3, "Support from Coach Klaus in everyday life" (Page 34).*
    </aside>

- **Community & Social Interaction**
    - The platform includes a community area with **thematic discussion rooms** and **"highlight walls."** **Regular, moderated community calls** are also held. This fosters peer learning and allows users to exchange ideas and solutions.

    <aside>

    - *Reference: Section 8.4, "Community & social interaction" (Page 36).*
    </aside>

- **Reflection and League Development**
    - At the end of each match day, progress is visualized through scores, progress bars, or other symbolic animations. While a full league change only happens after a new tactics check, the user's current standing and progress toward the next level are made visible to maintain motivation.

    - *Reference: Section 8.5, "Closing, feedback and league change" (Page 37).*
    </aside>


### **Phase 4: Applying Knowledge with the Process Intelligence Engine (PIE)**

This is a key feature that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application.

- **Analyzing Real-World Processes**
    - As part of a match day's "Transfer Application" phase, users can describe one of their firm's actual processes via voice or text, or by uploading a document.

    <aside>
    ⛔

    - *Reference: Section 5, "Function & application logic" (Page 16).*
    </aside>

- **Receiving Actionable Feedback**
    - The PIE, powered by the **Aleph Alpha** language model, analyzes the submitted process. It identifies weaknesses (like media discontinuities or lack of automation) and provides concrete, actionable recommendations that are linked back to the platform's learning modules. Coach Klaus moderates this feedback, turning it into a coaching conversation.
    - *Reference: Section 5, "Semantic analysis with Aleph Alpha" (Page 16) and "Integration with Coach Klaus" (Page 18).*
</aside>

## **What we have understood regarding PIE:**

### **When is the PIE used?**

There are two main scenarios:

1. **As a core part of the learning journey:** The PIE is a dedicated step within a "Match Day." According to the Discovery_Detailed_Project_Briefing.pdf (Page 33), it's part of **Phase 4: "Transfer application."** The The Forge Learning Framework.pdf calls this the **"Playing Field"** phase. This is the moment where the user stops learning theory and starts applying it to their own work.
2. **As an on-demand tool:** The briefing also mentions that the PIE can be "booked as an optional add-on at any time" for spontaneous process reflection outside of a structured Match Day. *(Reference: Page 18, "Role in the learning journey & as an add-on")*
- The "Transfer Application" / "Playing Field" phase begins. Coach Klaus appears and says: *"Okay team, we've just covered the key elements of a smooth client onboarding. To make this real, **tell me exactly how you onboard a new client right now.** You can describe it to me, or even upload your current checklist document."*

### **How is it used? (A practical example)**

Let's imagine a law firm is in a module about "Client Onboarding" and they've just completed the "Knowledge Impulse" phase.

1. **The Prompt (Triggering the PIE):**
2. **The User's Input:**
    - A team member speaks or types: *"Well, first the client calls and we write their details down on a notepad. Then, our assistant types those notes into a Word document. We print that document for the client's physical file. After that, someone manually enters the client's details into our billing software..."*
3. **The Analysis (What the PIE does):**
    - The PIE sends this text to the Aleph Alpha model. The AI analyzes the steps and identifies specific, pre-defined weaknesses based on what was taught in the module.
    - **Identified Weakness 1:** "Media Discontinuity" (Notepad -> Word -> Print).
    - **Identified Weakness 2:** "Lack of Automation" / "Redundant Data Entry" (Word -> Billing Software).
4. **The Feedback (The "VAR-Zone" phase):**
    - In the next phase of the Match Day, Coach Klaus delivers the feedback conversationally. He doesn't just list errors.
    - He might say: *"Thanks for sharing that. I noticed you're using a notepad and then re-typing the information. Remember in the last video how we talked about reducing manual steps? A simple digital form could send that information to both the client file and the billing software automatically. This is covered in more detail in **Module 4** if you'd like a refresher."*
