### **Project Workflow and Timeline Dependency**

The project timeline is entirely dependent on the following sequential workflow, which will be applied individually to **each Match Day**:

1. **Client Provides Finalized Assets:** The client MUST deliver the **complete and final content** for a specific Match Day. This includes the **final, static 2D background image** and all required **video/GIF files for transitions**.
2. **Renesis Designs the UI/UX:** Using the client-provided image and content, Renesis will design the UI, which consists of overlaying the interactive elements onto the static background image.
3. **Client Approves the Design:** The design for that specific Match Day must be formally approved by the client.
4. **Renesis Develops the Code:** Only after design approval will Renesis begin coding the functionality for that Match Day.

This workflow means the project schedule is modular. Any delay in the client providing assets or approving designs for a Match Day will directly delay the completion of that Match Day.

### **Division of Responsibilities**

**Renesis (The Development Team) is responsible for:**

- **The Technical Platform:** Building the front-end and back-end infrastructure.
- **Implementing Interactivity:** Building the functionality for UI elements (quizzes, buttons, etc.) and overlaying them onto the client-provided background images as per the approved design.
- **Integrating the AI Coach:** Embedding the "Coach Klaus" D-ID avatar.

**The Client (Kristian's Team) is responsible for providing ALL assets, including:**

- The **final, static 2D background images** for every module.
- All **video files or GIFs** that will be used for screen transitions.
- All text, questions, answers, and logic for **Quizzes**.
- All narrative and logic for **Branching Scenarios**.
- All scripts and dialogue for **Coach Klaus**.

### **Key Features (As Detailed in the Document Below)**

1. **Static Image Backgrounds:** The platform does not have dynamic or themed backgrounds. It uses the pre-finalized, static images provided by the client to set the context for each module.
2. **Overlayed Interactive UI:** All interactive elements are built as a UI layer that is placed on top of the static background images.
3. **Future Expansion - No Editor Functionality:** It is explicitly agreed that the V1 platform **will not include a self-service 'Editor'**. To add any new content or leagues (e.g., 'League 4'), the client must **re-engage and hire Renesis** for a new development cycle, following the same asset-dependent workflow defined above.

### **Scope and Limitations**

As outlined in the "Feature Scope Summary" table in the document below, the project scope is strictly defined:

- **Dependency on Client Assets:** The entire project schedule is 100% dependent on the **timely delivery of final, approved images, videos, and content from the client** for each individual Match Day.
- **Web/Desktop Focus:** The initial build is for the Web/Desktop platform.
- **Out of Scope:** Sound design, voice input, and a fully responsive mobile version are not included in this phase.
