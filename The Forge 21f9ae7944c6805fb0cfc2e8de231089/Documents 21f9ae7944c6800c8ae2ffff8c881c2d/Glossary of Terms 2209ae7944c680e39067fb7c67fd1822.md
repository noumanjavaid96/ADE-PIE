        - **Playing Field (3 Matchdays):** Dedicated to practical tool application, peer feedback, and applying learned concepts within the user's own context. The Process Intelligence Engine may be utilized here.
        - **VAR-Zone (1 Matchday):** (Video Assistant Referee Zone) - Designed for AI-driven reflection (with Coach Klaus), mood tracking, scoring/assessment, and receiving suggestions for improvement. The Dartboard Reward System is part of this phase.
        - **Level-Up (1 Matchday):** Focuses on goal setting for future development, transformation planning based on learnings, and fostering personal commitment to apply these changes. League assignments might be influenced or occur here.
