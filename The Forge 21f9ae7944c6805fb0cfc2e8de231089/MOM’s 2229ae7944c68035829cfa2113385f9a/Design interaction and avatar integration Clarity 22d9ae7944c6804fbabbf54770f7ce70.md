# Design interaction and avatar integration Clarity

Participants: Nouman Javaid, Kristian Erxleben
date: July 11, 2025

### **Screen Resolution and Video Display**

- Video stops when resolution becomes unsupported or image quality degrades
- Maximum size maintained until visual quality threshold reached
- Background image integrity preserved - stops scaling beyond optimal point
- Solution: Display message requesting larger screen when limits exceeded

### **Visual Effects and Interactivity**

- Neon light effects possible on dark backgrounds
    - Pixel-based illumination creates glow effect on hover
    - Works because surrounding elements remain unaffected
- Sports shirt animation (wind/movement effects) not feasible
    - Requires 3D rendering or embedded video animations
    - Would need different technical approach and designers
- Hover effects limited to elements that donâ€™t impact surrounding scene lighting

### **Avatar Integration Strategy**

- Full-body avatar integration confirmed possible with premium D-ID account
- Green screen approach for avatar placement
    - Avatar displayed as overlay on scene backgrounds
    - Not integrated into 3D environment
    - Positioned anywhere on screen (not small window)
- Account setup pending AWS configuration - login details expected next week
- Background selection critical - open field or neutral settings preferred

### **Design Collaboration Approach**

- Preference for direct design collaboration rather than external agency
    - Avoids third-party complications
    - Maintains control over creative process
- Communication strategy shift needed
    - More calls, less written documentation
- Creative solutions possible within technical constraints
    - Reduces misunderstandings and misinterpretations

### **Coach Klaus Interactive Features**

- 90% spontaneous AI-driven interactions
- 10% pre-recorded welcome/transition videos
- Automatic intervention triggers:
    - Three consecutive quiz mistakes
    - Low confidence scores detected
    - Contextual help provision
- Emotional response system requires detailed documentation with specific examples and triggers

### **Next Steps**

- Detailed flow document to be shared for client review and input
- Internal team communication about design collaboration preference
- Technical requirements clarification for emotional AI responses
- Background design exploration for avatar integration
