# LMS Design and Gamification Strategy for Learning Platform

date: July 4, 2025

### **Platform Structure & Navigation**

- Three distinct leagues/levels with different stadium environments:
    - Beginner League: Basic training pitch and facilities
    - Intermediate League: Small stadium
    - Expert League: Large dome stadium (100,000 capacity)
- Each league contains approximately 15 distinct rooms/areas
- Pre-defined navigation paths between rooms
- No free-roaming/360Â° movement - all transitions are pre-recorded
- Unity-based development required for 3D environment creation

### **Coach Klaus Integration**

- Digital avatar powered by DID (Digital ID) technology
- Requires 7 minutes of video recording for avatar creation
- Will appear contextually within stadium environments
- Two interaction types:
    - Pre-recorded responses for standard scenarios
    - AI-powered responses (starting from point 5 onwards)
- Limited daily interaction credits with option to purchase more
- Will provide feedback based on confidence scores

### **Content Structure & Flow**

- 9 match days total
- Each match day contains multiple sections
- Core content types:
    - Video lessons (5 min duration)
    - Interactive quizzes
    - Branching scenarios
    - Process simulations
- No time limits on quizzes or sections
- Must complete sections sequentially
- Progress saves automatically between sessions

### **PIE (Processing Intelligence Engine) Integration**

- First implementation in Match Day 5
- Document handling:
    - Initially PDF only
    - Potential for handwritten document processing later
    - GDPR compliance required
- Using LLAMA 3.3 (70B parameter model)
- Adaptive decision engine provides additional content based on confidence scores

### **Interactive Elements**

- Flow chart creation tool needed
- Drag and drop exercises
- Downloadable certificates/achievements
- Integration with Google Meet/Teams for live coaching sessions
- Note-taking capability for live sessions

### **Visual Design Requirements**

- Stadium-based theme throughout
- Three distinct visual styles per league level
- Pre-recorded transition animations between areas
- Coach Klaus to be integrated naturally into environments
- Design must support future gamification elements

### **Development Priorities**

- Core LMS functionality first
- UI/visualization second
- PIE integration third
- Coach Klaus interaction system fourth
- Gamification elements final phase

### **Timeline & Next Steps**

- Design team to provide rough estimates by Monday/Tuesday
- Timeline and milestone plan needed for first phase
- Team meeting scheduled for Monday morning
- Will assess cost implications of various design approaches
- Need to determine exact room count and types per stadium
