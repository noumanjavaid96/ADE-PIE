### Context

Meeting with Kristian and team to discuss Coach Claus Platform development, focusing on the onboarding process, confidence scoring mechanism, and overall user experience strategy. The platform aims to create an innovative learning experience that goes beyond traditional LMS systems, incorporating gamification and emotional intelligence through an AI coach named Coach Claus.

# Brainstorming

**Onboarding Process**

- Initial questionnaire is standardized for all users
- Welcome video features popular German sports commentator (Champions League)
- Companies get one user account initially, even if multiple employees
- Process includes:
    - Company onboarding
    - Appointment confirmation
    - Preparation questionnaire
    - Welcome video and calendar booking

**Evaluation & League Classification**

- 10 different models with 10 questions each (100 total questions)
- Scoring system: 1-6 points per question
- League classifications vary by model (e.g., Starting League, Playmaker League)
- Example threshold: “if you have minimum of 20 points, you are in the starting league”
- Users can be in different leagues for different models

**Coach Claus Interaction**

- Not just a chatbot but “sensitive guide with emotional intelligence”
- Avatar remains visible but only activates upon user interaction
- Session memory stores interaction history and points
- Free text field available for coach’s notes (not used for classification)
- 45-60 minutes window for completing two matches per week
- Coach adapts tone based on confidence score

**Platform Design Vision**

- Aims to feel like a video game rather than traditional LMS
- Christian: “in our mind, we are talking about a video game”
- Want users to feel “inside the stadium”
- Need to balance innovation with technical feasibility

# Decisions

**Technical Implementation**

- Will use session-based interaction limits to control AI costs
- Coach Claus will maintain context awareness of current course content
- Need to determine exact credit system for extra coaching sessions

**Next Steps**

- Team to provide timeline estimate by tomorrow/day after
- Christian to prepare mood board/design inspiration documents
- Need to define MVP milestones for investor presentation
- Schedule follow-up meeting to review execution plan
- Team to compile final document covering onboarding, Coach Claus, and complete six steps

**GDPR Compliance**

- Ensure sensitive company information remains protected
- Focus on process documentation rather than sensitive client details
    - Only super admin role can access certain confidential information
