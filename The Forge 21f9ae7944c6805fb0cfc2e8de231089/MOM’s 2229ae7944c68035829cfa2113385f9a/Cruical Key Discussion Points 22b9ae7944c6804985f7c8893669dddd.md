# Cruical Key Discussion Points

date: July 8, 2025

### Meeting Summary (July 8, 2025)

The meeting involved Kristian Erxleben (client) and members of the development team (Muhammad Nouman, Muhammad Hamza, Bilal Khalid). The primary agenda was to align on the project's direction, particularly concerning the design of the virtual environments and the associated budget.

**Key Discussion Points:**

1. **Design Process & Alignment:**
    - Kristian emphasized the need to start with a small, concrete example (e.g., two rooms) to ensure both teams share the same vision before full-scale development. He needs to see a design that makes him feel they "got it."
    - Bilal acknowledged that designing immersive environments is fundamentally different and more complex than standard web application design, as it requires everything to be built from scratch without templates.
2. **Budget and Scope Concerns:**
    - Kristian expressed significant concern about the project's cost increasing from an initial quote of around â‚¬27,500 to a new estimate of **$38,000 - $42,000**.
    - He stated that his team's requirements had not changed and this increase created a "not a good feeling." He strongly urged for fixing the project scope and the final price to avoid further business discussions and focus solely on development.
3. **Justification for Cost Increase:**
    - Bilal explained the price hike was due to two main factors that were more complex than initially understood:
        - **Environment Design:** The work is not conventional UI design but intensive, from-scratch environment creation.
        - **Custom LLM Implementation:** The requirement shifted from using a standard API (like OpenAI's) to deploying, managing, and ensuring the stability and compliance (GDPR) of a private, open-source LLM. This adds significant backend infrastructure and development effort.
4. **Proposed Next Steps:**
    - The team suggested a phased approach:
        1. **Discovery Phase:** Finalize and get approval on all user stories to lock in the project's functional scope.
        2. **Design Phase:** Begin the design work, potentially for a fixed cost, to build the client's confidence in the visual execution.

### Client Feedback Email Summary

Following the meeting, Kristian sent an email expressing urgent and direct dissatisfaction with the initial design implementation.

**Core Feedback:**

- The current design **does not align with the "Variant 2" vision** that was briefed and discussed.
- The implementation feels like **static background images with UI elements and a video layered on top**, rather than the intended immersive, 3D-like spatial environment.
- It completely lacks a sense of space, depth, and interactivity. The "Coach Klaus" character is not integrated into the environment but just looks like an overlay.

**Client's Ultimatum:**

Kristian directly linked the poor visual quality to the new, higher price point, stating the **$42K cost is not justified** by the current creative delivery. He demanded a binding response to three questions by **1:00 PM the next day**:

1. Can the team technically and visually implement the "Variant 2" vision as described?
2. If yes, when can they see a proper example?
3. If no, the client will remove the design package from the scope and reallocate it.
