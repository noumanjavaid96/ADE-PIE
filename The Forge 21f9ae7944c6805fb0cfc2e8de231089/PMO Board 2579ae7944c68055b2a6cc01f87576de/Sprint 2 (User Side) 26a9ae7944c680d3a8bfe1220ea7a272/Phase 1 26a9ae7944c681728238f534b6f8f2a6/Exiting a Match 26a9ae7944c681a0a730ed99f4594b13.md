## 🚪 EPIC 9: **Exiting a Matchday / Module UI**

**🎯 Goal:** Define the user experience after completing a Matchday or Module, including Klaus outro, rewards, transitions, and progression cues.

### 1️⃣ **Matchday Completion Sequence**

- [ ]  **1.1 Final Activity Completion**
    - User completes last activity (quiz, PIE reflection, simulation).
- [ ]  **1.2 UI Indication of Completion**
    - Themed message: *“Matchday Complete!”, “Great Work!”*
    - Rewarding sound effect + animation/graphic.
- [ ]  **1.3 Coach Klaus Outro**
    - Klaus avatar activates for closing message.
    - Summarizes key takeaways (session memory or pre-scripted).
    - Provides positive reinforcement and encouragement.
    - Previews next stage of the journey.
    - Delivered with D-ID animation, voice, and subtitles.
    - UI subtly shifts focus to Klaus during outro.

### 2️⃣ **Transition from Matchday**

    - Clear themed button options:
        - *“Return to Game Plan”* → module overview.
        - *“Proceed to Next Matchday”* → next sequence.
        - *“View Your Progress”*.
- [ ]  **2.2 Cinematic Transition**
    - CTA triggers immersive transition (as defined in EPIC 3.2 & 3.7).
    - Moves user to Hub, Dashboard, or next Matchday/Module.

    - Clearly indicated in UI.
- [ ]  **3.5 Transition**
