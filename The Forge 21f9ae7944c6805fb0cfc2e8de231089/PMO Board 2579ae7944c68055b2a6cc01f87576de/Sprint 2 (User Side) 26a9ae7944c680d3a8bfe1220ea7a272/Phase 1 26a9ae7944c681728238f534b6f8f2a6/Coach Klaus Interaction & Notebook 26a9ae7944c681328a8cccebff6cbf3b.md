## üèüÔ∏è EPIC 6: **Coach Klaus Interaction & Notebook**

**üéØ Goal:** Define how users interact with Coach Klaus (on-demand, proactive) and how their learning journey is summarized and stored in the **Coach‚Äôs Notebook**.

---

### **6.1 On-Demand (User-Initiated) Interaction with Coach Klaus**

- [ ]  **Activation Cue:** Subtle, themed icon near Klaus (chat bubble, glow, hover effect).
- [ ]  User clicks Klaus‚Äôs avatar/cue to initiate interaction.
- [ ]  Klaus transitions from idle ‚Üí ‚Äúlistening/engaging‚Äù animation.
- [ ]  Dialogue box/speech bubble appears with:
    - [ ]  Styled **text input** field for user questions.
    - [ ]  Themed **Send/Ask** button.
- [ ]  Interaction ends via:
    - [ ]  **End Chat / Goodbye** button.
    - [ ]  Auto-close after inactivity.
- [ ]  Klaus returns to idle animation.

---

### **6.2 Proactive Interventions by Coach Klaus**

- [ ]  Triggered by ADE (quiz failure, low confidence, inactivity, achievement).
- [ ]  **Initial Cue:** Subtle, non-intrusive prompt near Klaus or user‚Äôs focus area.
    - [ ]  Examples:
        - [ ]  ‚ÄúCoach Klaus has a tip. [View Tip]‚Äù
        - [ ]  ‚ÄúLooks like you might need help. [Get Hint / No Thanks]‚Äù
        - [ ]  ‚ÄúGreat progress! Hear from Coach Klaus? [Yes/No]‚Äù
- [ ]  User Opt-In ‚Üí Klaus plays proactive animation + message (voice + subtitles).
- [ ]  Content powered by **ErxlebenGPT** (hint, micro-lesson, motivation).
- [ ]  Declining ‚Üí user clicks **No Thanks** or ignores, prompt fades.
- [ ]  Exceptional case: direct intervention (critical alert or narrative event).
