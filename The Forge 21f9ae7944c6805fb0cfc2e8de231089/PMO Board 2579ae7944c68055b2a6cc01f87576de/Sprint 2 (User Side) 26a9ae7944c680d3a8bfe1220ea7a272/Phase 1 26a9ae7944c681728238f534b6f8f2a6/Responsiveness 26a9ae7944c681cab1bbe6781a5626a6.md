## üì± EPIC 11: **Responsiveness Concepts**

**üéØ Goal:** Ensure the platform remains immersive, usable, and performant across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Core Goals for Responsiveness**

- [ ]  **1.1** Maintain immersion (sports-themed atmosphere preserved on all screens).
- [ ]  **1.2** Ensure usability & legibility across devices.
- [ ]  **1.3** Prioritize key interactions (Coach Klaus, core learning activities).
- [ ]  **1.4** Ensure smooth performance & optimized load times (especially on mobile).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Conceptual Approaches to Responsive Immersive UI**

- [ ]  **2.1 Adaptive Background Scenes (2D)**
    - [ ]  Crop/reframe on small screens to focus on key areas.
    - [ ]  Provide simplified variants of backgrounds for mobile (less clutter, better performance).
    - [ ]  Design backgrounds with multiple aspect ratios in mind.
- [ ]  **2.2 Responsive Layout of Embedded UI Elements**
    - [ ]  Flexible placement & resizing of content areas (virtual screens, tactical boards, consoles).
    - [ ]  Touch-friendly controls for tablets & mobile.
    - [ ]  Greater use of themed modals on mobile for text-heavy/complex tasks.
- [ ]  **2.3 Coach Klaus Avatar on Smaller Screens**
    - [ ]  Adaptive positioning/scaling to avoid obstructing content.
    - [ ]  Optimized dialogue interface for readability + input on mobile.
- [ ]  **2.4 Navigation Adjustments**
    - [ ]  Main Hub simplified on mobile (direct list/icon-based navigation).
    - [ ]  In-Matchday navigation: large, tappable ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù & progression cues.
- [ ]  **2.5 Prioritization of Content on Mobile**
    - [ ]  Content legibility & interactivity prioritized.
    - [ ]  Background remains atmospheric but less detailed on very small screens.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Design & Development Considerations**

- [ ]  **3.1** Figma prototypes currently only cover **Web** (mobile designs considered, not guaranteed until web designs complete).
- [ ]  **3.2** Performance optimization: assets scaled/optimized per device resolution.
- [ ]  **3.3** UI/UX designers and front-end developers collaborate for responsive execution.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Scope Summary: Can Do vs. Cannot Do**

- [ ]  **4.1** Provide a clear table separating current scope vs. future/limited/excluded features.
