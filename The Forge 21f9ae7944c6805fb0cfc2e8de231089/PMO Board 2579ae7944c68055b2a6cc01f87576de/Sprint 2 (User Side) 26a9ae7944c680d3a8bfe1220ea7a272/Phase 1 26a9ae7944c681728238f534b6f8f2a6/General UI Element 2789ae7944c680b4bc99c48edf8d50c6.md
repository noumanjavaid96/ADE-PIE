### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Design Philosophy for General Elements**

- [ ]  **1.1 Integrated, Not Overlaid**
    - Elements feel part of the 2D scene (e.g., button on console, notification on in-scene screen).
- [ ]  **1.2 Materiality & Texture**
    - Use sports/high-tech materials: brushed metal, plastics, LED glows, carbon fiber, glass surfaces.
    - Adapt visuals based on Room/Zone + League theme.
- [ ]  **1.3 Consistent Iconography**
    - Custom icon set aligned to sports theme + branding.
    - Unique icons for *next, play, submit, help, settings,* etc.
- [ ]  **1.4 Typography**
    - Use approved fonts (Manrope, Inter per Design Brief V2).
    - Ensure legibility and thematic hierarchy via weights/styles.
- [ ]  **1.5 Color Palette**
    - Follow Design Brief V2 palette (Blues, Orange, Beige, Forest Green).
    - Variations show hover, active, and disabled states.
    - Adapt palette with League theming.
