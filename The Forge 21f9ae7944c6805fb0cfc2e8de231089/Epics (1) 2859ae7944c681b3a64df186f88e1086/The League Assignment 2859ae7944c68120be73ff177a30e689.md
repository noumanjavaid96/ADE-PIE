2. What scoring thresholds determine league boundaries?
3. Should league assignment be based on overall score or weighted concept scores?
4. How often can learners be reassigned to different leagues?
5. Should there be a probationary period before league changes take effect?
6. What happens if a learner's performance drops significantly?
7. Should leagues have names that relate to football (e.g., Sunday League, Championship, Premier)?
8. How will the system handle new learners who haven't taken assessments yet?
9. Should there be social features that allow learners to see others in their league?
10. What visual indicators and badges will represent different leagues?
