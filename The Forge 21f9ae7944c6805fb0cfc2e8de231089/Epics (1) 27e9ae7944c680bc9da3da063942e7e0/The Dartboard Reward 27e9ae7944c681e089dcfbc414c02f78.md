Critical Questions & Ambiguities: 1. How should the dartboard animation be implemented (CSS, Canvas, or external library)?
2. What color scheme and visual design will be most engaging for learners?
3. How many tactical concepts should be represented on the dartboard?
4. Should the dartboard size and segment arrangement be configurable?
5. What performance thresholds determine the color coding of segments?
6. How will the system handle cases where learners have identical scores?
7. Should there be sound effects or other audio feedback during the animation?
8. What accessibility considerations are needed for visually impaired users?
9. How will the dartboard display work on different screen sizes and devices?
10. Should learners be able to customize the appearance of their dartboard?
