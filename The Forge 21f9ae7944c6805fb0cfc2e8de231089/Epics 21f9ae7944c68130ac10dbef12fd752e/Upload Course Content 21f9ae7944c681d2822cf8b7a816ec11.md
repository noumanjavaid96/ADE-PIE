Comments/Feedback: 09/10 LS: We need to discuss on using cloudinary. This is a US system and is not really GDPR compliant (only in enterprise mode, which is of really high cost). We were thinking on using the media storage on our Hetzner server for this.
GDPR is of HIGH importance for us & our customers!!
