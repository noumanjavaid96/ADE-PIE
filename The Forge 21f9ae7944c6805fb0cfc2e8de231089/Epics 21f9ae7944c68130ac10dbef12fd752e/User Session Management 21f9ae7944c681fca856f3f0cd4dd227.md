Critical Questions & Ambiguities: • What should be the default session timeout duration?
• Should we allow multiple concurrent sessions per user?
• How should we handle session conflicts across devices?
• Do we need session refresh tokens for extended access?
• Should we implement session hijacking protection mechanisms?
