# AI Coach Intervenes (Knowledge Graph)

Acceptance Criteria: [ ] System prioritizes concepts based on their importance and learner's current level
[ ] AI Coach considers learner's historical performance and learning patterns
[ ] AI Coach provides confidence scores for its recommendations (given the logic is provided @Kristian Erxleben )

Critical Questions & Ambiguities: 1. How will the Knowledge Graph structure tactical concepts and their relationships?
2. What algorithm will the AI Coach use to traverse the Knowledge Graph?
3. How will the system handle cases where multiple concepts are involved in a single question?
4. What machine learning models will power the AI Coach's decision-making?
5. How will the Knowledge Graph be updated as new tactical concepts are added?
6. What confidence thresholds will trigger different types of interventions?
7. How will the AI Coach balance immediate needs vs. long-term learning goals?
8. What data will be used to train and validate the AI Coach's recommendations?
9. How will the system handle edge cases where the Knowledge Graph is incomplete?
10. What feedback mechanisms will improve the AI Coach's performance over time?

User Story: As an AI Coach, I want to analyze failed quiz questions using the Knowledge Graph so that I can identify the specific tactical concepts (conceptIds) that need reinforcement and provide targeted learning interventions.
