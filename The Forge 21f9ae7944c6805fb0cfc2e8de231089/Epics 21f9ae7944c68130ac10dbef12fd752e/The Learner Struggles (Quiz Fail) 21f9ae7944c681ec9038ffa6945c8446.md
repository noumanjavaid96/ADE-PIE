Critical Questions & Ambiguities: 1. What constitutes a 'quiz fail' - specific percentage threshold or other criteria?
2. How granular should the concept mapping be for failed questions?
3. Should the system allow multiple attempts before triggering AI intervention?
4. What data structure will store the relationship between questions and concepts?
5. How will the system handle partial credit or nuanced wrong answers?
6. Should failure patterns be analyzed across individual learners or cohorts?
7. What privacy considerations apply to storing detailed failure data?
8. How will the system differentiate between careless mistakes and knowledge gaps?
9. Should there be different failure thresholds for different types of content?
10. How will the system handle technical failures vs. knowledge-based failures?
