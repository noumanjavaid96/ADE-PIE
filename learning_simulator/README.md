# Learning Simulator with Coach Klaus

This project is a self-contained web application that demonstrates the core functionality of a dynamic, AI-powered coaching system. It simulates a learning environment where a user's "Confidence Score" is updated in real-time based on their interactions, and an AI coach ("Coach Klaus") provides personalized feedback.

The backend logic for scoring and coaching is powered by a Pipedream workflow, which this application calls via an HTTP POST request.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Confidence Score:** A visual score and progress bar that updates with each user action.
-   **Interactive Quiz:** A simple quiz module to generate learning events.
-   **AI-Powered Coaching:** Displays personalized messages from "Coach Klaus" generated by the Pipedream workflow.
-   **Real-time Feedback Loop:** Demonstrates a complete user action -> API call -> UI update cycle.

## How to Set Up and Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Get the files onto your local machine.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Open the `learning_simulator/index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3.  **Get your Pipedream URL:** Make sure your Pipedream workflow is deployed and has an active HTTP trigger. Copy the unique webhook URL for that trigger.
4.  **Paste the URL:** In the simulator's UI, paste your Pipedream webhook URL into the "Pipedream URL" input field in the bottom-left corner.

The simulator is now ready to use!

## How to Use

1.  With the application open and the URL configured, simply click one of the answer buttons in the main content area.
2.  Observe the loading state while the application calls your Pipedream workflow.
3.  Once the workflow responds, you will see two things update:
    -   The **Confidence Score** in the top-left will change.
    -   A new message from **Coach Klaus** will appear below his avatar.

## Pipedream Workflow Requirements

For this simulator to function correctly, your Pipedream workflow must be configured to return a direct HTTP response with a specific JSON structure. The latest workflow version provided does this by default.

### Expected JSON Response Format

The UI expects the Pipedream workflow to return a JSON object with the following keys:

```json
{
  "confidenceScore": 85.5,
  "coachingResponse": "Excellent work! You've correctly identified the core benefit of serverless architecture. That's a key concept."
}
```

-   `confidenceScore` (number, required): The new, updated confidence score calculated by your workflow.
-   `coachingResponse` (string, required): The personalized message generated by the Coach Klaus AI.

If your workflow returns data in this format, the simulator UI will update correctly.
